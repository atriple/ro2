## objective
fine description of lagrange multipler with inequality constraint to solve non linear problems in Intro to Optimum Design by Jasbir A. Arora

## method 
using matrix calculation to solve the equation, the visualize it by plotting to cartesian coordinates

## libraries 
by using numPy to solve by matrix and partial derivative and matplotlib by visualizing the answer to 2d geometrical representation  

## how to use 
`run script.py`
show the plot, and see the command line to view the solution of the problems
`jupyter notebook`
viewing the notebook directly in github to view the explanation of the lagrange multiplier
