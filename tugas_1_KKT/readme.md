fine description of lagrange multipler with inequality constraint to solve non linear problems in Intro to Optimum Design by Jasbir A. Arora

## method 
using matrix calculation to solve the equation, then visualize it by plotting to cartesian coordinates

## libraries used
- numPY
  - solving matrix and partial derivate of the objective function

- matplotlib
  - visualizing answer by plotting to 2 dimensional cartesian coordinates

## how to use 
`run script.py`    
show the plot, and see the command line to view the solution of the problems
> please ensure that python is installed with numpy and matplotlib by using pip   

`jupyter notebook`    
viewing the notebook directly in github to view the explanation of the lagrange multiplier and how to solve the eqation by matrix
