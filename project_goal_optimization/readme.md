# goal programming 

programming = optimization 

## apa itu 
Goal programming is a way to satisfy (sometimes conflicting) goals by ranking the goals by priority. The optimization algorithm will attempt to optimize each goal one at a time, starting with the goal with the highest priority and moving down through the list. Even if a goal cannot be satisfied, the goal programming algorithm will move on when it has found the best possible answer. Goals can be roughly divided into two types:

As long as we satisfy the goal, we do not care by how much. If we cannot satisfy a goal, any lower priority goals are not allowed to increase the amount by which we exceed (which is equivalent to not allowing any change at all to the exceedance).
We try to achieve as low a value as possible. Any lower priority goals are not allowed to result in an increase of this value (which is equivalent to not allowing any change at all).
In this example, we will be specifying two goals, on for each type. The higher priority goal will be to maintain the water level of the storage element between two levels. The lower priority goal will be to minimize the total volume pumped.
